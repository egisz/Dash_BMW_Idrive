# Dash_BmwF10_Idrive integration

This repo contains a Vehicle Plugin for [Dash](https://github.com/OpenDsh/dash/) to support a 2010 BMW F10.

Current functionality:

* Idrive rotary input to scroll OpenAuto UI
* Idrive left/right/up/down/press to simulate OpenAuto UI keyboard input
* Reverse camera activation when gear shifter in Reverse.

It is likely that this plugin works with other years of F01/F07F10/F11 or even across the BMW lines. However I make no garuntees.
